This simple tool is designed to be run by a Keyboard shortcut from an Editor.
For example, for Kate use the externel tools plugin with the command:
konsole -e sh -c 'cd %directory && pwd && runit %filename ; echo Press any key to continue. && read -n 1'

All functionality is in the runit bash script, the other tools are just for testing 
and demonstration purposes.
